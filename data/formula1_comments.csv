As for Ferrari: Leclerc is a proven winner and it‚Äôs only a matter of time til‚Äô Sainz grabs one. I like that dude.

What did stand out like a sore thumb was his inconsistency. In from laps 36 to 61 (the period after the red flag), the difference between his fastest lap (a 20.4) and his slowest (28.0, excluding lap 59) was 7.6s, MSC's for comparison was only 4.7s between his fastest and slowest.

\- Verstappen's championship probability was at its lowest just after qualifying 2nd in Monaco (29%). Despite winning the Monaco GP, his probability was lower just after Monaco (31%) than just after the previous race in Spain (38%).   
  
\- The biggest single-day probability swing of the whole season was from the end of the Thursday to the end of the Friday of the Azerbaijan GP - 32% to 45% - as Red Bull showed great pace in FP1 and FP2.  
  
\- Verstappen was the favourite for the championship for 151 of the 153 days from after the French GP to after the Qatar GP, a span of 13 races, despite huge points swings to Hamilton in Great Britain and Hungary.  
  
\- Verstappen's probability actually increased from 68% to 76% after qualifying 2nd in Great Britain, despite Hamilton being ahead of him. And despite a 25-point swing to Hamilton in Silverstone, Verstappen's probability was still 71% just before practice in the next race.  
  
\- Just after the Sao Paulo sprint, Verstappen had an 80% chance of winning the championship, the highest his probability was for the whole season. Two days later (one day after Hamilton won the race), it was down to 63%.

Attack mode is much better for racing on these tighter tracks, as you generally have to overtake and be overtaken, but it's still fair for everyone.

Starting with the next British Grand Prix, the Formula 1 weekend will undergo a change in format regarding media activities. After introducing the weekend planned over three days at the beginning of the season in order to keep the duration of the trips as short as possible, the FIA took note of the negative opinions received from the media regarding the press conferences organized on Friday morning.

The two free practice sessions scheduled immediately afterwards actually took away a lot of space from the drivers' conferences, given the priority of the results that emerged at the end of FP1 and FP2.

The International Federation has backtracked and from the Silverstone weekend there will be a return to the old format, with media activities returning on Thursday afternoon. FIA conferences will feature 10 drivers (divided into two groups of five) and will begin 23 hours before the start of the FP1 session, as per the rules. The first free practice at Silverstone is scheduled for Friday at 1 p.m., determining the start time of the press conferences at 2 p.m. Thursday.

Drivers who will not be selected for the conference have been asked by the FIA to be on hand for a media session to be run by their respective teams.

formula1,"&gt; why did they sign him in the first place? Alex could of achieved that small goal 

Alex could also have buckled under the pressure and gone backwards. Red Bull had made an assessment that Alex had no long term future with RBR. Much like Sainz, they made a decision to cut a driver even though they could have kept him. 

With that assessment made, the decision on who to put in the car was easy - you consider who is the best driver for the next 12 months. Even if you think Albon could eventually be better than Perez, it‚Äôs clear that Perez is currently the more experienced and more consistent driver. 


&gt; Alex, you can tell how desperate that signing was, last moment lifeline to convince Max to stay with them moving forward into 2023, 

There‚Äôs no chance Max based any of his decision to stay on Albon‚Äôs signing. Max stayed because Mercedes didn‚Äôt have a seat for him. Max would know that it‚Äôs 2022 that matters, who was driving for Redbull in 2020 didn‚Äôt matter at all for that goal.",

He was over-praised by the media as the successor for the greatest driver of all time and I think he let his ego get the better of him today. And to be fair, after proving that he had the potential to win races, if not championships, given the right car on top of being showered with praise from drivers and media alike for a phenomenal drive, who *wouldn‚Äôt* feel like hot shit?

He was rightfully judged today, and I think it‚Äôs good that Wolff and others are holding him accountable for his behavior, but I also hope that in the next few days he‚Äôll learn to keep his head down and be a bit more mature when things like this occur.",

The full answer is a lot more nuanced but what it boils down to is a combination of different factors. First and foremost, there is a new design ""template"" shall we say that is coming out next year for how the cars are supposed to be designed and what areas can be upgraded. Second, is the implementation of a budget cap. While this doesn't cover all elements of F1 operations, such as driver salaries, marketing, and the three highest paid employees, the budget cap will significantly hamper multiple teams' operations and ideally level the playing field a bit more financially speaking. Finally, beginning in 2023, there will be an engine freeze implemented which prevents engine suppliers from further developing the engines.

formula1,"If the harder compound is 1 second slower than the softest, instead of doing 25 / 15 / 10 they will do 1 / 30 / 19.

Strategy will definitely play a role, but it's not going to be about using the 'worst' tyre to it's full effect, it will be entirely about minimising the impact of that tyre.

Whether that is starting on the hardest tyre, doing 1 lap, putting on mediums and hoping for a safety car.

or qualifying on soft and doing 1 lap, put on the hards and go long and be super conservative. 

I think what you're after is 3 stints on different compounds with strategic 'i can do 30 laps on hards, or push hard for 25 laps then later coast on the mediums'. But I feel with the amount of tracks that are currently a one stopper.... the 'worst' tyre will simply be used for such a brief time and then discarded imo.

[If we pick Spain](https://imgur.com/HtdOcdE) and instead of the 2nd set of Mediums, Lewis puts on the Hard and say it's close to 0.8-1.4sec difference in tyre. Over 24 laps, he's better off putting on the hards, doing one lap, pitting for mediums and going back out.

So it's not like he's had 190 realistic chances to win a race, he was good enough to be selected by a top team, picked the wrong top team to go to, got sent back to the midfield, and had to get really lucky in freak circumstances to win from there. He actually overtook everyone from last place on lap 1 to finally pull off the victory at Racing Point, which is unprecedented, that's probably why he's back in a top team now.

Won't work anymore, because they don't want to fill in your information personally. They want you to make an appointment. Less ways to make mistakes.

And testenvoortoegang.nl is the only one that adds the results for entrance to events.

What day do you land? If you land at Schiphol, go to the Albert Heijn Supermarkt in the main plaza of the Airport. That's at the main exit/entrance and ground level.

You can buy a prepaid vodafone or T-Mobile sim card for cheap and use it for your registration. 

They'll also text you the registration code to that telephone number if you test negative, so don't throw it out. And everyone will need a different phone number.

You can easily book a same day test, because most events are cancelled. In July I took a testenvoortoegang.nl test at 1900 and got the result within 1 hour. The only caveat is the test must be taken at least 2 hours before the official start of the event and max 24 hours before the start.

It's been considered and multiple drivers have suggested that should be done. 

In 2017 (after similar incidents with Hamilton and Vettel in the last decade) Bottas very likely got lucky with a start and starting moving too quickly to actually be reacting to the lights going out, and both Vettel and Ricciardo suggested that that should be a false start. 

It got enough traction after the Hamilton one in 2014 that [Charlie Whiting even commented on it](https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/drivers-allowed-to-gamble-at-race-start-whiting/456846/) and noted that there essentially isn't a rule against trying to anticipate the start because the penalty for messing up his high enough. 

But other sports do have exactly that. It's a false start in Olympic spring if you move faster than human reaction time after the starting gun, same principle as the new pit stop rules.

He also knows that he's getting older. Injuries take longer to heal, reaction time slows, it's harder to learn new skills. 
I would say that the fact that a generational talent like Max in nearly equal if not slightly faster machinery hasn't just wiped the floor with him probably feels really really good. Even if he loses this championship, it won't have been by much. I have the feeling that Lewis' emotional intelligence won't let him waste too much time feeling sorry for himself.",

You can see the RB bouncing at the replay at 55s, before the contact with the Merc. The commentators mention the kerbs launching him into the Merc as well.

Thanks to that, Max A) turns in less due to the traction loss, increasing the chance of any contact putting you above someone who does turn in from the outside, B) bounces around more, increasing the chances of going airborne after contact. To make it worse, both RB and Mercedes have said that the kerbs are too aggressive due to the risk of damaging the car. The kerbs there take away any possibility of Max going any further left, where a typical chicane at least offers the chance of cutting the corner to prevent damage.",

formula1,"My point is that F1 has new owners and they want to make a return on their investment, just as the France family wanted to make NASCAR a huge success.  France did it by manufacturing drama in every race in any way they could.  It was not fair to the individual drivers but the sport grew so quickly as did the dollars that the drivers put up with being a half lap in the lead with 3 laps to go and the inevitable caution for 'debris on the track' as they started making so much money overall.  Now this caution was not manufactured but the last lap under green was.   NASCAR has gone to a Green/White checkered flag.  If a race is ending under caution it will always go to a 2 lap shoot out.  A white flag lap and the last lap.   It is not necessarily a fair decision but a money making decision.  I see some of that thought process in Masi's decisions throughout the year.",:formula-1-2018: Formula 1
formula1,"Red flag procedures. 

Stop free damage repair and pitstops under a red flag. If repairs are needed either move the car either to the back of the pack or back a predetermined amount based on time splits before the incident occurred and the work done. Work above what could be done in a pit stop could still allowed with the car automatically placed at the back of the pack. Tyre changes would only be allowed for safety such as a change in weather or tyre failure risk.

I'd get rid of the standing restarts, all restarts should be rolling restarts following the safety car restart procedure. The only exception would if the red flag was within the first two laps, then have a standing start instead possibly with the original grid. Damage repair restrictions would still apply.

Unlapping.

I'd like to see this stopped after both a red flag and a safety car. Perhaps still allow lapped cars to overtake the safety car but not wait for them to catch the pack. The race director should also have the option to send all lapped cars to the back of the pack (as pre 2011 I think). This can be done quicker than overtaking the safety car. If in the rules it would have been a good option last weekend.",

formula1,"There are so many factual errors/incorrect comparisons in this post...... this belongs in discussion/comments. Not a standalone thread. Max wasn't covering the difference nearly fast enough for one. And the Marshalls unable to clear it in time meant that if all cars were allowed to unlap, we would've finished behind safety car. That's not an opinion. That's a fact, one that neither Hamilton or Max or any fans should disagree on. The legal choices for Masi was either no cars to unlap with 1 racing lap, or cars to unlap with finish behind safety car. 

And I'm not sure you understand football either with that extra time added but the minutes not lost in normal time calculation.",

formula1,"I have to give you that, you're one of the more civilized Hamilton supports I have encountered lately.

Well if you rewind to the first lap you will see Max do a classic dive bomb while Hamilton cuts a large portion of the track clearly gaining an advantage and overtaking off track. Hamilton should have given the position back or been penalized in my opinion but they didn't. I don't think it's a conspiracy against Verstappen tough, it's just that if you show good sportsmanship as your default behavior (what Hamilton normally does) they will tend to give you the benefit of the doubt when they are not entirely sure. Max on the other hand is continuously trying to find the fine line which they should not cross and sometimes overstepping it. If they are not entirely sure about something he did he will not get the benefit of the doubt.  However with the whole appeal mess and the absence from the gala I'm pretty sure that Mercedes as a whole has lost that privilege.",:michael-masi: Michael Masi

Whilst everyone has been at pains to stress he is a deserving champion, the conversation is very much about how without the mistake made by Masi, Lewis would have won.

Over the season yeah, probably Max did better and had more ""bad luck"", so you could argue it balances out, its just different, a tyre blowout is the racing gods, a race director applying the rules in a new way is subtly different.

Of course we don't know that LH wouldn't have spun out if the SC continued to the end, but probably he would have won.",

formula1,"Translation

The International Federation has entrusted Peter Bayer, FIA General Secretary of Sport, with the responsibility of the single-seater area, making the two names that are at the center of the recent controversy disappear.¬†There has been no removal: the two are working on planning the 2022 season, while the fresh president Ben Sulayem awaits the results of the investigation that was launched after the events in Abu Dhabi.

Mohammed Ben Sulayem, fresh president of the FIA, has chosen Peter Bayer as head of the single-seater area.¬†It will be up to the Secretary General of Sport of the International Federation to follow the open wheel competitions and, in particular, Formula 1.

In short, Ben Sulayem instructs the Austrian to become the interface of Stefano Domenicali, president and CEO of F1, in the paddock.¬†The FIA ‚Äã‚Äãappoints a prestigious figure to take care of the championship which this year launches a technical revolution to bring the world of GPs into a new era.

The fact that the name of Peter Bayer instead of Michael Masi, F1 race director, and Nikolas Tombazis, technical manager, appeared in the new FIA organization chart under the single-seater entry.

Those who have limited themselves to commenting on the changes from the graph published by the International Federation have drawn wrong conclusions, very wrong because both Michael Masi and Nikolas Tombazis are operational in their posts and are planning the 2022 season that is about to start.

The feeling we had is that the legislative body has no intention of carrying out a removal, but intends to ""protect"" the figures most exposed to the media and therefore involved in heated controversies, also to avoid the admission of mistakes.¬†Therefore the exact opposite of what is being said.

For a few days the English press has been pulling out some advances according to which Mercedes urgently awaits answers: according to the British, the presence of Lewis Hamilton at the start of the season would be conditioned by the results of the investigation that the FIA ‚Äã‚Äãhas launched (still under the president by Jean Todt) after the disputed Abu Dhabi GP.

It is evident that Lewis's silence is part of a strategy that is being ridden by Brackley, but it is equally certain that the hepta-champion will be regularly in his place on the W13 silver arrow, otherwise the Star would find himself with a huge problem to begin with. the new cycle of F1 without the most representative driver, while counting on the arrival of George Russell.

And in all this, in the middle of the story, there was the change of the FIA ‚Äã‚Äãpresidency with Jean Todt who closed his mandate to give way to Mohammed Ben Sulayem.¬†The British would not have voted Graham Stokker, their compatriot candidate, to support the Arab manager.

The Daily Mail, in fact, claims that tomorrow there will be a meeting between Ben Sulayem and Toto Wolff to discuss Masi's position.¬†It is clear that there is a strong attempt to pressure the FIA ‚Äã‚Äãto decide the jubilation of the Australian race director, but it seems more a media attempt than an actual strategy.

When Mercedes withdrew from appealing the Abu Dhabi decisions that led Max Verstappen to the world title, there was no requirement in exchange for eliminating Masi and Tombazis (guilty of following Red Bull's guidelines on the flexibility of the rear wing of the W12 which led Hamilton to be penalized in Brazil for the non-compliance of the distance between the profiles).


According to our information, the Stuttgart company could decide, having accepted the sporting verdict, to ask the FIA ‚Äã‚Äãto be allowed to go to a civil court, to bring a lawsuit for damages if any guilt emerges from the federal investigation.¬†That seems to be the real sore point of the matter ...",:anthoine-hubert: Anthoine Hubert

To which I can agree then if I want to.

Of course it's also possible for the parties to include any clause they want in the contract (unless it's something against the law of course). For example, a driver could have a clause in their contract that in case Big Team X comes knocking, they have the right to terminate the contract.

On the other hand you can have separate termination clauses which can be triggered by only one party. These are often related to performance etc.",

&gt;The problem with this line of logic is always where do you draw the line

Somewhere. That's always going to be the case no matter where a track is. People seem to think that it's only high profile accidents that are reviewed and changes made, but it's all of them. Nobody was injured because of the extremely high noses, but they were removed because of the potential for injury. The same goes for tracks, even if there weren't accidents at corners they may make changes either based on driver feedback or simply due to internal review.

If they do go back to Jeddah, there will be changes to that corner where Mick and Cem crashed, be it the curb, the barrier pushed back, realigned or potentially using a safer barrier.

I watched the last 10 or so minutes of the session, and then as he was walking off with his girlfriend I said to him ""Hey Mick, all the best for the race this weekend, I hope you have a great one.""

Was talking to an engineer at a leading Formula E team a few years ago. He was saying that 90% of the budget came from marketing, with 10% from R&amp;D. There's very little trickle down tech from FE to road cars - in fact he said there's more that goes the other way, from the road cars to the FE team. He didn't know for sure but expected it to be the same in F1.

So yeah. If F1 went back to NA engines, Mercedes, Renault and any other manufacturer would likely quit. You might get a deal like the Alfa Sauber deal, where Alfa is a title sponsor (no technical involvement at all) but the manufacturers wouldn't be running or owning the teams like they do now.

The exception is Ferrari, but you'd likely end up with a scenario where Ferrari supplied engines to teams, maybe alongside an independent engine manufacturer such as Gibson.",:ayrton-senna: Ayrton Senna

For reference, the new F1 TV deal in the US is expected to be ~$75 mil/year, whereas the expiring NASCAR one is $350 mil/year and the new one will certainly grow larger than that.

formula1,"&gt; I'm talking about racing performance. I work in the non racing side of that research. It's not easily applied or at least as easy as people act like here.

How about things like declining reponse times (which is one of the most important factors in ability to correct over/understeer and when to ease off the brakes, which combined is 90%+ of the skill of being able to drive an F1 car. If you take 0.01s longer to respond to oversteer or the brakes starting to lock up, that costs you a huge amount of time per lap.

This is probably also why women don't typically make it to F1, because they have lower response times on average.

&gt; Also unlike other sports people at least recently don't seem to be retiring due to age related decline in performance.

I think it's hard to argue that drivers like Schumi, Massa and Kimi didn't retire due to no longer being as fast as they once were, just to name a few. Or that Vettel is no longer as fast as he once was. The only exception seems to be Alonso, although this is difficult to say since we have no idea how fast his current teammates are compared to the ones he had in the past.",I survived Spa 2021 and all I got was this lousy flair

Even in his championship year Frentzen was ahead of him on the road more times than not but was plagued by horrible luck and reliability. The only teammates he stacked up well against are Zonta and Panis. Not really a glowing career record. If he wasn‚Äôt in that Williams (in a period where it was by far the fastest car on the grid and even then was pushed to the last race) he never would‚Äôve gotten a win, let alone a podium in his entire F1 career. 

He was great in CART, but so was Sebastian Bourdais, who scored all of 4 points in a season where Vettel got a win and scored 35 points. (10 point scoring system). Zanardi was another CART champion who scored 1 point in his four season F1 career. CART success has no meaningful translation to F1 at all and judging Villeneuve from his F1 results he was absolutely mediocre, and probably the most undeserving champion in the history of the sport.",

Then of course the question is wether he could have even flown to Australia on that day. My understanding is that Australia only allows a limited number of people into the country, which is understandable considerung their qurantine rules.

You could argue over who had a worse season but 18 or 19 doesn't make much of a difference. 

The minimum expectation on any driver is to be close and even beat his teammate. Some fall short on this but they should still able to bring in maximum points for the team, like Bottas. Both of them fell short on both of these expectations. At the end of 2019 season, I was expecting (and rooting for) Seb to go out with a bang after it looked like he was done in Ferrari and Albon to be closer to Max.

But that's just not true.

At it's best, NASCAR is .25:1 horsepower to weight whereas F1 is .5:1 at it's worst.

&gt;Oval racers also get more experience with close wheel-to -wheel racing that would serve them well in F1 if they ever make it there and get up to speed.

How do you figure? NASCAR is about bump-drafting and rubbing, whereas contact is going to end your race in F1.

&gt;It seems like there are always NASCAR drivers running really competitively at the Rolex 24, and I think it shows that NASCAR drivers are more skilled and complete (road course) racers than people give them credit for.

I mean, he'd go off, and the next lap, go off again at the same place. No one else is repeating the same mistake over and over at the same corner, while not racing anyone else.

formula1,"As far as I‚Äôm concerned open wheel racing in North America died with the ‚Äúsplit‚Äù in the mid 90s. It tried to hang on but the death of CART in the early 2000s pretty much put the nail in the coffin. I haven‚Äôt been able to watch it ever since. 

Back then CART was as good as F1. It had a nice international feel to it even though it was primarily an American thing. It had a nice mix of mostly road course with a few ovals mixed in, especially Indianapolis. But what made it attractive to me seemed to be what turned it off for too many Americans. Too many road courses, not enough ovals and too many foreign racers involved. Many Americans seem to prefer the simple things when it comes to racing. If it does more than go around in a circle it‚Äôs too hard to understand.

Now that Tony George is out of the way maybe Indy Car can regain the glory it had back in the golden days of CART. Penske is a much better steward for open wheel racing than George was.",

They have a militant government, which technically only exists because they are in a constant state of war and embargo.

The current escalation happened because Israel was once again evicting Palestinians out of their homes and did fucked up shit like throwing tear gas into a mosque which is very important to Islam as a religion.

And... You're not going to like this...

Sato was absolutely in the right when he was making his pass inside of Grosjean. In IndyCar, whether or not you're a lap down means little so long as you aren't blocking or being a hazard. So Sato going for the overtake because he had the faster car was correct. And then the other thing is that, the typical driving convention in IndyCar is that if you get your car halfway alongside the leading car, you have a right to that lane. 

When Sato made his move on Grosjean, Sato got more than half way alongside. The inside line was his. Contact, very very minor contact, inconsequential contact, was made because Grosjean went for the apex when the corner wasn't his.",:formula-1-2018: Formula 1

Difference  between him and other drivers or personalities generally is that they don't come out and explicitly say that it isn't them managing their social media, there is still that element of intrique that it could be them.

Joe Saward said that allegedly the actual Alpine team wanted to have Bottas and Ocon for 2021 and onwards. Allegedly Bottas was in talks with the team and everything. But Renault corporate wanted Alonso, and that's what ended up happening.

Alonso's deal is for 2021 and 2022, I believe, and I could certainly see Bottas coming to that team for 2023. Which would mean that in the case of Russell becoming Hamilton's teammate at Mercedes, Bottas would have a year off in 2022. But he wouldn't be the first Finn to take a sabbatical.

When Bottas was at Williams, pre-2017, the team was a whole different place. I just don't see them investing in a driver like Bottas looking at their history after 2017. By ""driver like Bottas"" I of course mean a driver who expects a salary.

I mean, Stroll brought in money, Sirotkin brought in money, Russell brings in money, Latifi brings in money. Bottas won't.

lewis' years in F1 :  
2007 : (17 races) mclaren were solidly in second place in the constructor's championship before being banned for cheating. they got 24 podiums that season. at least one driver was on the podium in every race.

2008 : (18 races) mclaren were second in the constructor's championship. they got 13 podiums. they failed to be on the podium in 5 races this season.

2009 : (17 races) mclaren were 3rd in constructors and got 5 podiums. 5 podiums in 5 different races.

2010 : (19 races) mclaren were 2nd in construtors and got 16 podiums. they failed to be on the podium in 8 races.

2011 : (19 races) mclaren were 2nd again and got 17 podiums. they failed to podium in 3 races.

2012 : (20 races) mclaren were 3rd again and got 11 podiums.

2013 : (19 races) mercedes were 2nd and got 9 podiums.

2014 - 2020 : mercedes were 1st and got at least 25 podiums in every season. in 4 seasons they got over 30 podiums. not splitting these out because i doubt anyone could claim max had a more competitive car that the mercedes from these years.

max's yeas in F1 :

2015 : (19 races) toro rosso were 7th in the constructor's championship and got no podiums

2016 : (21 races) torro rosso were 7th again. max was promoted to red bull after 4 races. red bull were 2nd in the constructor's championship. torro rosso got 0 podiums and red bull got 15 podiums after max joined. (for comparison, mercedes had 33 podiums this year)

2017 : (20 races) red bull were 3rd and got 13 podiums.

2018 : (21 races) red bull were 3rd and got 13 podiums.

2019 : (21 races) red bull were 3rd and got 9 podiums.

2020 : (17 races) red bull were 2nd and got 13 podiums.

so there was 1 year (2009) where lewis had a car that was less competitive than most of the cars max has had, and even then it wasn't very far off and was dramatically more competitive than the worse car max has had.

When he hit Jacques Villeneuve at 1997, I guess he was thinking I hit Hill at 1994 and I won the title, now I will hit again and I will win again.

This is an absolutely classic F1 tactic and a classic F1 incident: get significantly alongside, such that any collision could be argued to be a racing incident; refuse to back down.

We saw it with Lewis and Nico a few years back - Nico backed down for a few races, before eventually having to make a stand and refusing to back down again. We also saw it with Senna and Prost.

Lewis and Max both did the 'right' thing in racing hard and in posing a threat to one another: back down or we'll have a collision.

Both did the 'right' thing in refusing to back down.

Therefore they had a collision.

Lewis will still feel that he was right to pose that threat to Max, and Max will still feel he did the right thing by refusing to blink. In the context of the race, Lewis obviously got lucky and came out on top; in the context of the WDC, that refusal to back down stands Max in good stead, and it makes the remaining races a whole lot spicier for us.",:we-say-no-to-mazepin: #WeSayNoToMazepin

""One thing important to understand is that, despite the FIA stewards handing Hamilton a 10-second time penalty for his part in the collision, they did not rule him to be entirely to blame for the accident.

As a comparison, when George Russell was handed a three-place grid penalty for his clash with Carlos Sainz Jr in the sprint race, the stewards were explicit that he was fully to blame.

In that verdict, they wrote: ""Car 63 is judged at fault for the incident.""

formula1,"It also helps that Verstappen, Ricciardo, and Alonso all have the same, unusual driving style where they're fastest in cars that basically constantly oversteer because they're so good at controlling the rear end, and in general can hold more speed through turns.  This is actually the more unusual driving style on the grid - Vettel and Norris are the most obvious examples of the alternate style when they're really good at throwing the front end around - braking hard and throwing the car the shortest path around corners, but can lose the rear end at times.

So it really helped Verstappen to come straight into a car that was already set up for Ricciardo, who drives the same way he does.  The same goes for Alonso this year, going into a car that was set up for Danny Ric naturally he'll be up to speed pretty quickly because the car is already how he drives best.  Gasly, Albon, Norris, Sainz, LeClerc are all the opposite driving style, so while it might seem surprising, it makes sense for all of the following: Gasly looks better in the AT, Albon struggled in the RB, Sainz got up to speed quickly in the Ferrari, and Ricciardo struggled in the McLaren set up for Norris.

Notice I left somebody out?  Checo doesn't really fit cleanly into one style or the other (notably along with Hamilton), so in theory is probably the best fit for RB outside of Danny Ric and Alonso, which obviously didn't/won't happen.  But Checo has had the same issue he had before joining RB...inconsistent qualifying.  It's easy to look really good in a midfield car with a couple of great performances because nobody notices when you're just a complete non-factor in other races.  In a contending car, you notice those weak performances, and I don't think Checo has been anywhere worse or better than he should be expected to be based on his history.",:daniel-ricciardo: Daniel Ricciardo

Gotz was then third. With a lap or 2 to go, a completely different and unconnected team in the championship but who also buy Merc GT3 cars was told to stop their lead 2 drivers and let Gotz through, giving up their 10 second lead of the race.
 Gotz received 25 points...won the title by 3 points.

Crossing that white 'divider' line behind the bollard as Perez did was not legal under normal circumstances. But I think we can all agree Perez did nothing wrong here. Thankfully, so did the stewards.

I don't think there are rules for this particular instance, so Hamilton can't be at fault... even if he did cause Perez to do something that shouldn't happen.",

Man leaves space for Perez inside, it's a rainy day and he has to leave more cause someone can lock up. Ask Bottas and then Perez hits Gasly &amp; Alonso

He did what he supposed to for clean race. It's Alonso's luck that he he didn't foresee that Gasly can't go left. Alonso should have been faster and get out of that position. Gasly had nothing to do.

What a shitshow. Alpha Tauri should appeal that. I can't believe Marko watches this. If that happened to Max, he would tear the ALL WORLD APART.

RB have rode their luck a bit in the last 3 races in regard to Mercedes' own issues. Valtteri engine penalty at Monza and Max and Lewis crashing. Sochi, another penalty for Valtteri, Max had one too, but skipped his +3 in doing so. In the race Lewis got luck to win, but Max had bigger luck to get 2nd. Valtteri also got lucky to get good points. Rain affected luck for all 3. RB didn't get any luck in Turkey, but made the most of Lewis and the rain.

Dutch people don't care about having a Max centric feed. The Spaniards don't mind having a feed that focuses more on their drivers. It's what people usually want, thr drivers of their nationality tend to done who they relate to more and so are more interested in how they are doing.

Sky are not going to change that, because the British is who they produce for.

The perogative is on the network in other countries that provide the sky feed to their markets to either press sky to provide a second international feed, or to produce their own broadcast, or to hybrid it so that their have their own commentary they can lay over in the race.",

formula1,"They don‚Äôt have more speed, they have family.",
formula1,"I said this somewhere ender too, but if you're going to give Gasley a penalty for that weak shit, than you have to give Sainz a penalty for his pass on Vettel. I like Sainz but if you're going to give shit penalties on lap one, you have to give shit penalties later too (I forget exactly what lap lol). Especially when Sainz just fucked up his breaking and drove into Vettel instead of getting sandwiched.",
formula1,It's akin to Grosjeans Spa start where he was suspended races. Yet DTM obviously like it...give KVL just a 5sec penalty to help the show...which does nothing but encourage him. KVL is gloating on Instagram that the right man won...and shows zero remorse at all. Pretty insane standard to set for the championship.

d. Relevant Canons of Construction 

i. Omitted-Case Canon

 Nothing is to be added to what the text states or reasonably implies; that is, a matter not covered is to be treated as not covered.12 Essentially, this means that even though legal texts can sometimes be incomplete because they fail to address certain situations, courts should not fill in these gaps with rules of their own.13 F**or example, in one Supreme Court opinion, a taxpayer underpaid his taxes by $7,000, but was only found to have negligently underpaid by $700. The taxpayer argued that the statute imposing a penalty for underpayment of taxes should be read to require payment in ‚Äúan amount equal to 5% of the amount of the underpayment attributable to negligence.‚Äù** The Court, however, refused to fill in the gaps of the statutory language that simply required payment in ‚Äúan amount equal to 5% of the underpayment,‚Äù even though this led to an arguably less reasonable result.  
iii. Negative-Implication Canon

 The expression of one thing implies the exclusion of others.18 This means that where certain terms have been explicitly set forth in a statute, that statute may be interpreted not to apply to terms that have been excluded from the statute. For example, one could argue that a statute that prohibits ‚Äúany horse, mule, cattle, hog, sheep, or goat‚Äù from running upon lands enclosed by a fence does not apply to turkeys because the statute does not explicitly proscribe turkeys.19 Be aware, however, that this doctrine assumes that the enacting legislature thought through the statutory language ‚Äúcarefully, considering every possible variation.‚Äù20 In reality, there could be other reasons for legislatures to omit terms from a statute  
That kind of stupid interpretation.

That being said, Alex Jacques, commentator for F1TV's pit lane channel until last year and for Channel 4 starting in 2021 is sooo much better than Crofty. He's knowledgeable, but doesn't try to show it off with statistical tidbits. His attention is equally divided between the actual track, the video monitors, and the data screens because he _never_ misses on track action, even when it's off camera.

Jean Todt once was asked about this idea of a ""Ferrari No. 1 driver"" and he continues to profess that there was never such a thing. There is only ""the driver who can win it for Ferrari and must be supported by the team to allow Ferrari to win"".

So while what happened to Leclerc sometimes may seem a bit funny, it must be said Ferrari have been known to do this since the earliest days of racing.  Everyone in the team is directed by some mystical force called ""Ferrari"" to perform, to win.

It's definitely not according to the rules, but if you look at all the build up of 'let them race' and the note before Abu Dhabi that stated the focus would be on racing, I can see how this influenced Masi's decision. 

In my opinion this was also why they didn't react during the first lap incident with Verstappen overtaking Hamilton. Brundle and Palmer called it a legitimate move, but Hamilton could keep his position. Brazil was another example, where this time it was Verstappen who got away with the off-track defending.

Regardless whether these decisions were right or wrong, it showed that there was a strong desire to let them race. Finishing under the SC would have been a logical ending to a race, but the pressure combined with Mercedes and Red Bull influencing the 'referee' on the radio made it into the events that we saw.

People often disregard the context of the build up and time pressure Masi was under, and forget the difficult job he has.

I get that the decision was of direct influence to the outcome of the championship, but the ease with which people throw him under the bus is more a sign of the times I guess.",

It's a difficult comparison to make/prove, as they don't race on the same tracks...that is at least with one exception when both formats raced in Austin at COTA a few years back. Autosport's YouTube page did a video on this after it happened, and I believe they said the Indy Cars were about 10-12% slower in one lap pace, closer to F2. Indy Cars will top out a bit higher (especially with the one areo package), but F1 cars are designed for balanced aero - to take slow, medium and fast corners at the highest speeds they can without sacrificing too much in top speed through the straights because of drag penalty.

When verstappen got a fightable package he was the most consistent driver on the grid and made fewer mistakes than Hamilton. His reckless aggression at times was mostly in defense when he was on a disadvantage pace wise
I think the errors that come from drivers like max and Charles are when they want to extract more from the car than what it actually has. They don't want to be fighting for p4s but want to be winners as they've done in their younger times. Hence the looking for extra results in crashes

I know what I'm saying is a simplification but I feel the people saying Sainz has a big chance in this championship because leclerc is a hot head are in for a disappointment. If leclerc is 2 tenths faster each time he won't be getting a hot head. Sainz will not be in this title race because he is 'consistent' and 'cool'. Leclerc was consistent that's why he won f2 and f3 in his debut seasons. Sainz will have to go full aggressive rosberg himself if he wants a shot at this.

If the upgrades fails to deliver what was expected on paper then it's a lose but bringing in nothing and wait on a normal format in Miami would make AT losing just so hard at Imola, also taking up some risk at Imola can being useful to collect data about those upgrades and know how it works in reality.

It's interesting to see of the ""flow of upgrades"" at the upcoming races (according to Gasly) are going to help the team to put them closer in the midfield fight because currently it's a serious struggle to even collect some points, aside of the RBPT reliability question who should really make steps quickly.",:pierre-gasly::pirelli-wet: My Worst Nightmare

This was bang in the middle of their rivalry at McLaren.

The 1980s is a lot closer to the modern era of safeness than it is to the 1970s, if you look at the effectiveness of the methods. Berger's crash at Tamburello in 1989 was seen as a testament to how safe formula 1 cars had become... and oddly the marshalls seemed much more able to get his fire out quickly than they managed with Grosjean. Maybe less fuel escaped or something. They certainly weren't better at putting fires out back then.

My opinion:

Both are very quick but Vettel is probably naturally quicker. 

Vettel is somewhat bad at split second decisions especially during the first lap but he is a better overtaker than Rosberg.

Who is better at driving shitbuckets, well Seb is not super adaptable but I would also say we we never really saw Rosberg drive a really tricky car.

When it comes to the mental side of things I definitely believe Rosberg is stronger in the sense that  his team mates have challenged him both on track and off. He doesn't let external factors affect his driving as much. Vettel seems to need a lot of support to be comfortable, he drives better when he just has to concentrate on the driving and not really worry about the team or competing team mates. On the other hand I don't think Rosberg had the same focus while driving that Vettel has when he's at his best. Vettel also has this will to win (that sometimes borders on him feeling like he is entitled to it) which I think has helped him produce both some his best and worst moments (by worst I mean thinks like Multi 21). This will to win and focus also makes Seb more consistent in producing really great drives in a way Nico didn't really do until the very end of his career.

So to summarize, imo Vettel, he is quicker a better racer and when he is comfortable he has a winners instinct that makes him both more focused and consistent.",

The budget cap should allow for teams to work within tighter margins &amp; be on a level playing field.

Some teams share facilities &amp; exchange parts.

Dominance is nothing new; there was Williams, McLaren, Ferrari, Red Bull, and now Mercedes. There will always be a team dominating; and there will always be someone to overthrow them. The job is to be the best and stay the best, while everyone else‚Äôs job is to catch up &amp; dethrone the best. That‚Äôs how you push for excellence in a sport deemed a world championship. 

‚ÄúA stroke of ingenuity‚Äù is extremely unlikely given how tightly written the technical regulations are. Even something like DAS only came about because Mercedes had the money to throw at it; a team like Williams wouldn‚Äôt have had the resources to gamble with a eureka project like DAS, blown diffuser, double diffuser, or mass dampers. 

Spec parts aren‚Äôt even that bad? The halo is a spec part, the ECU is a spec part. Spec parts are important in terms of safety and controlling certain elements of the sport to either keep the cars safe, or to prevent teams from cheating. 

I just completely disagree with sharing data; it sets a bad precedent and teams at the top will think ‚Äúwhy should we spend this much on developing this only for backmarkers to get it next year‚Äù. It punishes hard work, and honestly will create a bad work environment. 

The budget cap on performance related expenditure is the best way to go, for now. Money is the biggest factor in this sport, so let‚Äôs see how that levels the playing field. I have no doubt that the smaller teams have smart people in their engineering teams; look at Mercedes for example. Their technology director was the technical director at HRT; but he left for Mercedes when HRT couldn‚Äôt pay his salary. 

Small teams know what to do, but they can‚Äôt afford to spend money on something which might not work on track when it works in the wind tunnel/simulator. Even out the money, and then everything else should be more even.",Brendon Hartley

But I am disagreeing with Irvine being that close to Schumacher.

 He was the biggest Schumacher fanboy ever and never complained about anything unfair. 

He said in an interview that his quali lap in Australia1996, the first and the only race of 1996 which he outqualified Schumacher, was the best of his career.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; In 1999 MSC and IRV were extremely closely matched before the incident. 

Irvine was really lucky that season. Schumacher's engine stall in AUS, hitting the wall of champions and the famous brake failure helped Irvine to be equal on points after Silverstone. But Irvine retired only once in Imola when he was going only for 3rd place (4 pts) anyway.

In 1999, Schumacher outqualified Irvine 9-1 (Spain was the only expection), which was still as impressive.",:jochen-rindt: Jochen Rindt
formula1,"Hamilton's 2010 season is generally rated pretty highly as well. Both of them took the championship to the final race in cars substantially slower than the Red Bull's. McLaren was faster than Ferrari in the first half and slower in the second half. They were probably about even overall.

 I've just finished rewatching the whole season and Alonso has a period really from Australia all the way though to Silverstone where nothing seems to go right for him. Yes sometimes they were his mistakes but often those errors got compounded by misfortune. Look at Silverstone - He overtook Kubica off track, Kubica retired before Alonso could give the place back, he was then given a drive through penalty, then the safety car got immediately called out. So a mistake that would usually get resolved with a quick reversal of position now dropped Alonso from 4th place to dead last. And this was in an era where overtaking was sufficiently difficult that you couldn't just blast back through the field.  

So I'd say that for me Alonso was the driver of the season (at least out of the WDC contenders) and I'd rate Hamilton's campaign just a fraction lower.",

formula1,"Translation

The renewal of Lewis Hamilton's contract with Mercedes is expected to close in the coming days, as the seven-time champion is willing to accept a term of one year plus an option for another season, overcoming one of the limitations that blocked the signing.

Immediately after falling ill with COVID-19,¬†Hamilton¬†had a few days of despondency in which he even thought about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãretiring from¬†Formula 1¬†, but it was the result of a momentary mood that the Englishman overcame.

What was the point of leaving the world of the grands prix on the eve of a championship that could lead the Briton to his eighth world drivers' title, leaving him the most successful winner of all time, beating¬†Michael Schumacher¬†?

Now Hamilton is willing to sign for two years: 2021 plus an option for 2022, fulfilling the offer that¬†Mercedes¬†had made him¬†.

Toto Wolff¬†had given his pilot time until the preseason tests to be held in Bahrain from March 12-14.¬†Regardless,¬†Brackley's team will present the W12 on March 2¬†in an online launch and have promised that the drivers will be there on that occasion.

The feeling is that Wolff originally made promises to his driver that he can't keep now, especially after¬†Ola Kallenius¬†, president of Daimler AG, put up stakes so that he couldn't get out of a well-defined fence.¬†However, the release on the duration of the contract could lead to unraveling the other outstanding knots.

Therefore, we expect a signing in the next few days, also because Hamilton has not stepped on Brackley and it would make sense for him to see the W12 that the technicians led by James Allison are preparing for him, perhaps discovering the novelties in the simulator.",:anthoine-hubert: Anthoine Hubert

formula1,"&gt;**Formula E and the FIA have put in place financial penalties designed specifically to deter manufacturers from quitting the championship during the forthcoming Gen3 era.**

&gt;The new rules set will run between the 2022-23 and 2025-26 seasons, notably boosting power up to the equivalent of 470bhp while introducing a 120kg weight reduction per car.

&gt;The FIA has issued a second version of its Registration Procedure for Car Manufacturers that covers Gen3, which now includes a new clause to better prevent teams from leaving.

&gt;Should a manufacturer exit the series, it will have to continue to pay the ‚Ç¨300,000 registration and homologation fee charged per season until the end of the rules cycle.

&gt;This ""exclusive remedy"" from the FIA, not included in the first draft released in December, will have to be paid in one lump sum within 60 days of the manufacturer's withdrawal date.",Williams
formula1,"Will never get the 28/30 votes and I'm glad it won't. Why would you do that before seeing how 2022 regs pan out?
Also best way to fix the F1 issue imo is to do single lap shootout qualifying where the cars do their lap one at a time so the camera can be focused on them only so the fans can actually see the cars go around in qualifying and make a bit more exciting than just the finish line. And do it where the car leading the championship goes first. Theoretically they have a slight disadvantage over the slower cars going the latest and might shake up the order a little bit.",
formula1,"Mad Max would have probably won Suzuka without Chuck there to crash him out and Vettel further down the order, I believe he would have beaten Bottas and also Silverstone would have been a podium without Vettel wrecking him.

formula1,"I think a lot of people shit on the MCL32 just because it was a slow McHonda, and some of that carries over to the livery. The shade of orange they used was legitimately gorgeous, and given the lack of sponsors they had to fill space on the car, they did a good job with the overall design. 2017 had some good looking backmarkers in the Toro Rosso, Mclaren, and Sauber that a lot of people seem to sleep on.",Misc.

formula1,"Well this is not actually a political matter if, with ""political"", you mean ""related to an ideology"".

I'm curious to ask to some Italian nationalist now what do they think about the ""mar√≤"", but I think I went too far off-topic now.",
formula1,"Is the aerodynamic package always perfectly symmetric about the car's long axis?

Usually there is 1 (or 2 max) new races per year and they're known for years in advance so they can start planning and developing it for the game.

I don't understand the hatred without trying the idea first. I mean it's not as ludicrous as the reverse grid idea! Then what's the trouble in trying? I've been following F1 for more than twenty years now and would love to see something new tried. Several major sports are trying out new things. Take Cricket for example, there was tremendous opposition when T20 was introduced. People said it would kill off Test cricket. Yet here we are more than a decade later and both are flourishing. In fact, Test Cricket has grown even more popular than before. So why can't we try something new in F1?",F1

Until you see that he notices camera man is about to walk into something, and helps him out. And it's all cool. And totally unrelated to anything...

Treat it like it's a dramatic TV show where you know the reality may lie somewhere in the middle. If something particularly looks entertaining, look it up afterwards.

Editing anything can be creative, for drama. Whatever the medium.

I think Drive to Survive was VERY successful at what it was intended for - to give a behind the scenes look and to attract viewers who were not fans. And on that it succeeded. Any behind the scenes is going to have a narrative, a villain, a hero, some drama - it is TV remember!

And whatever you think about Grosjean, he was the Director (co director) of the Grand Prix Driver's Association - so to me that says everyone else has a level of confidence in him as a person, as a leader, as a mature figurehead to represent the drivers interests.

see the thing is, the teams have a lot more data than you might think.

they know exactly how fast a driver is. when it comes to perez/hulk, according to the data they have, red bul is saying those two are around 3-4 tenths slower than max.

now if for some reason perez was to be faster than max, and the teams had the data to support it, SURELY a top team wouldve picked him up then? i mean yes, rb picked him up, but as a clear nr2 driver and they only barely signed him over albon. had albon had one or two better races, who knows who gets the seat then.

max is by most (that includees the paddock) seen as either the fastest or 2nd fastest driver on the grid, and nearly everything he does backs up this claim. we can take a relative comparison. heres one, max&gt;ricciardo. ricciardo&gt;ocon. perez = ocon. i would rate perez on a very similar level to ocon. so i dont see it how you could possibly think that max isnt gonna beat perez rather convincingly.",:toyota: Toyota

formula1,"Many reasons.  F1 is a business and it is about money and viewers for TV money and sponsors.  If Merc runs away with it every practice then maybe fewer people tune in because we all know who will win . . . again.

driver and teams like to be the under dog so they have an emotional story to tell about how amazing they drove to win, ""even though"" their car is not as fast.  A driver wants the glory as an amazing comeback.  And then, if they lose, the driver can safe face by saying the ""car did not have pace"" to keep up, i.e. blame the car.  

If the team has an amazing design, and shows it is amazing on track, they will be copied.  If they run slow on track, it is less likely they will copy the amazing design.

The list goes on and on.  Same reason that EVERY year every team talk about how fast the other teams are and that they have lots of work to do to catch up.  It is all BS but meant to build drama and excitement for viewers.",

He has talent and has proven to be cocky and sure of himself, dont worrie if doesnt beat Gasly this season, drivers need time and that doesnt mean they are bad, give him a Merc and sure he'll be fast but we need to remember midfielders dont break nor twist as good so give him time to adjust.",:sergio-perez: Sergio P√©rez

The commentary is boring AF. But the whole production lacks so much in comparison to the UK version.

The people talk like weirdos, they talk about drivers with their first names but then they adress them formally in Interviews (which is super noticable for every german and pretty cringe for most) 

Also as soon as something extiting happens the fake yell of the main commentator (not Ralf) make me want to turn off the TV.
But it's not like Ralf would do anything to help the situation. Yeah It's nice that he can speak from experience but his speaking voice is sooooo dull. 

Also he just comes off as rude and generally unlikable, you are 
right.

As soon as Vettel spins or does something remotely bad they claim that the UK ""colleagues"" are biased and that they will make it out to be much worse than it is. In my personal opinion the UK Team is maybe biased towards the british drivers but definetly not against the germans. That claim is so ridiculous and they do it so often that I really don't wanna watch.

Honestly... and I know I'm nobody, have no clue how it is to run such a program, but from a viewers (22y.o) perspective they should replace the whole team and try to reinvent themselves.

A lot of these problems (and more!) were present in the RTL Boradcast, but hey it was free.
I have yet to see good german coverage of a GP. 

Come to think of it, THE BEST german coverage we had was by PietSmiet Mexico 2019. And these guys talked outta their asses, didnt catch some stuff and had no analysts or Data.

That's not a golden age to emulate by any stretch.

I'd say part of it is the regs, honestly.  For too long Formula 1 has been tinkering to try to prevent anyone from being too dominant.  But the fact of the matter is unless you're willing to do a Ferrari in 2005 and blatantly kneecap a team (works for Ferrari, which is deeply sentimentally attached to the sport- I think Daimler AG would be much less willing to put up with such behavior), you're just helping the big guys with more staff to throw at a problem.

That VPN is usually a subscription of about 5 ‚Ç¨ per Month, paid annually, but you can use it for many other things too. Watching Canadian or US Netflix with a lot more variety.

We had tickets for the Barcelona 2020 GP, which we na√Øevely rolled over to 2021 season in blind hope, but our country's restrictions means we won't be able to travel and can no longer get a refund. 

We're not looking to make a profit. Not even looking to break even, but as close as we can would be nice. 

Only thing is, as we need to be named on the ticket (ID is required on entry for contact tracing reasons), putting them up on the normal sites like Viagogo just means the buyer is gonna get burned by it as there is no way for us to contact them to transfer the names.

And a country is undeserving if all they have is a crappy boring circuit and lots of oil money to throw into tourism.

But we're all allowed to decide for ourselves who we think deserves what.",

But yes. I can‚Äôt imagine Ferrari or of AM get their rake figured out sneaking up stealing a win in a normal weekend. When the inevitability happens and Hamilton and Verstappen take each other out...maybe.",
formula1,"I may be biased, but I don't believe the Thai connection thing was that huge once he made it to F1. It certainly did play a huge role in him securing funding to continue his junior career after he was dropped from Red Bull originally, but I feel like if it was such a big thing with his Moose sponsorship, he would have had the funds to go into a team like Haas or something. Better to be in F1 on the grid, even in a bad team, than from the outside looking in imo.

I believe RB does still believe Alex has the ability to drive, but given how bad 2020 went for him, and the chance they have this year given the stability of the regs, they have to try to do something to even get close to beating Merc. It certainly looks like the right move now. And perhaps in the event Pierre leaves AT, they might put Albon in there to be the ""benchmark"".",:alexander-albon: Alexander Albon

formula1,"It doesn't. They're two competing design concepts. Prior to this year, the low rake concept arguably was the winner at generating downforce with the least drag. The reg changes reduced floor area this year, the impact seems to be hitting lower rake cars more, reducing their downforce by a greater amount compared to higher rake cars. 

As it relates to corner speeds, this means high rake cars will gain more time in corners relative to low rake cars, compared to last year. Bahrain was a track where downforce plays a relatively small effect, whereas Imola will cost teams that can't generate as much downforce more time.",:mclaren: McLaren

Three seasons in and too many people still do not understand this, because what they really want is a show about the racing. That's okay, it's reasonable to want that, but there already is an official end of season highlights DVD produced every year. Drive to Survive is something else.

I've been watching F1 for about 25 years now. I think Drive to Survive is fine and enjoyable for what it is. I don't care that they overdramatise some things or add sound effects or make relatively small changes for dramatic effect. Yes, F1 is more than dramatic enough if you've followed it and you understand the politics and the personalities, but it's just not realistic to expect people who are not already F1 fans to see it that way.

If there are solutions for Mercedes and AM, than they either underestimated the changes or they didn't do a really good job over the winter.

You just can't deny that the teams that improved realtive to Mercedes have had their focus on improving the rear of the car.  And getting a better engine (mclaren, Ferrari and Red Bull).",:max-verstappen: Max Verstappen
formula1,"I got flamed on the Friday after Sakhir GP practice for suggesting that a great performance by George Russell would put pressure on Mercedes and Lewis by extension. Arguments essentially boiled down to: one good race does not mean Russell can do what Hamilton can do. And no, it cannot. But now top level drivers such as Ricciardo are comfortable admitting that they think they could do a solid job in that car. 

‚ÄúRussell, in a way, showed the possibility of that by pretty much beating Valtteri in his first race. So you could argue that just maybe Lewis doesn‚Äôt have the strongest competition.‚Äù

I think that many Formula 1 fans don‚Äôt want to be guilty of not appreciating Lewis enough during his career. I get that. But Brundle and Ricciardo have now publicly mentioned the Sakhir GP as validation that at the very least, a Mercedes seat alongside Bottas is not the most difficult job on the grid (to put it mildly). Brundle even went so far as to suggest that Russell‚Äôs performance was a key factor in Hamilton‚Äôs contract negotiations. Formula 1 is an ultra fast-paced world, and one high profile performance can change many perceptions in the paddock. Russell did some damage in that respect.",:super-aguri: Super Aguri

formula1,"Next year will be a deciding year for Alpine. I highly doubt they‚Äôd bring in a rookie for such a season , when so much is at stake for them. 
They deeply identify as French and that‚Äôs one of their main marketing anchor points. Gasly is the most successful french driver in F1 right now and he‚Äôs not driving for the french team? People in France will question that. The government of France also is a shareholder of the Renault group, and the president himself seems to like Gasly very much, even calling him after his win. Gasly also is highly regarded by the French public. Alpine highly relies on a positive image to the french public, or else they will be pressurized to pull the plug. I think there is no doubt, that IF Ocon gets replaced, it will be Gasly filling his seat. In that case, I see Ocon placed at Williams by Mercedes replacing Russell. Or Mercedes decides to go for a all new lineup with Russell and Ocon, if Hamilton retires. In that case I can see Mercedes going for Gasly too, although Ocon would be much more realistic. Bottas days in F1 will most likely be over after this season if he‚Äôs not hugely overdelivering. If a Alpine junior performs good enough in F2 this year, I can see them trying to place that driver at Williams, or maybe at a new team, that we right now don‚Äôt know of.

He had rookie Hulkenberg in 2010, and rookie Maldonado in 2011. He won against all those teammates, which is respectable but hardly impressive.

He lost to Schumacher (fair enough) and fairly convincingly to Button (except for 2008, by very slim margins).

DC had Damon Hill, Hakkinen, Raikkonen before he had a teammate who would not become WDC. He then beat all of them til his final season against Webber (whom he beat in 2007), by which time he was clearly over the hill. Even so, he beat Hakkinen in 1997 (and obviously 2001, though Mika had seemingly checked out by then).

I don‚Äôt think DC was great, but if we‚Äôre comparing records against teammates, they really aren‚Äôt too dissimilar. Dispatched the part-timers and the merely mediocre, struggled against WDC-calibre.

Also, if there ever was a season where did DC drive really well, it was 2001.

The whole point about Raikkonen‚Äôs 2003 was he super-consistent, whilst everybody else had problems or made silly errors. They were rarely the fastest on any given day. McLaren won 2 races (one of which was gifted to them - Australia - though I suppose you could argue that they should have had Brazil). Williams had the best car in 2003 by near-universal agreement and frankly fucked it to only come out with four wins. Ferrari got 8.

If there's fire or something that could be very bad. Carlos Reutemann was almost choked to death by catch-fencing that got wrapped around his wind-pipe. The catch fencing was also deformed so easily that the force of the cars also on occasion ripped the fence posts from the ground and became debris themselves, one of which knocked Geoff Lees out after hitting him on the head. 

They also take ages to put up again after they've been hit as they're often damaged in collisions, meaning they could cause more/longer red flags.

There were also rumors that the Mazepins actually wanted a full russian team with Nikita and Shwartzman, but Shwartzman wasn't ready for F1, so they took Mick. But this could very much change this season as Shwartzman currently drives in a Prema in F2.

Based on what I've seen, Verstappen and Hamilton have similar baseline talent (which is to say totally world class) but Hamilton has worked incredibly hard on ironing out any weaknesses he had (hot headedness mostly) and now is a totally complete driver, there is no part of hustling an F1 car around that Hamilton is less than top class at, Verstappen is still polishing but I think he has as much potential for sure.

formula1,"I'm going to have to disagree on two of your overrated tracks and one of your underrated tracks

Istanbul is frequently put up there because of Turn 8, but thats a disservice to the rest of the track imo. After passing through turn 8 you approach a challenging rather open tricky chicane which then allows cars to get a run on each other through the back straight into the final 3 turns which are cutback heaven. This then goes through into the downhill braking zone of a very tricky turn 1 and 2. If you want to watch this track at its best, watch the 2010 grand prix. Its just a brilliant track all round.

Singapore I'm going to completely disagree as I reckon its last sector is its weakest! The first 3 corners are a joy to drive. High commitment through Turn 1 straight into 2 while simultaneously slowing down for 3, trying to both keep the car stable while not missing the apex of 3. Run the car right by the wall on the exit for the best launch into Turn 4. Again run over the entry curb, early apex thru 4 and understeer just past the wall as you pick the throttle up as you go down the longest straight. Super challenging and super precision needed for a fast 1st sector. You then have a 3 boring 90 degree turns but with no run-offs and man mountain kerbs (aka the best kind of kerb). The last 90 degree of the 3 is deceptively difficult as the exit opens up encouraging you to open the throttle and again run as close to the barrier as you dare before approaching the former singapore sling. Now a tricky corner which wants you to just send it but its immediately followed by a right left chicane thats off-camber on the exit, which just wants to suck the rear end of the car towards the wall, Leclerc famously narrowly avoiding this fate on his pole lap in 2019. Then onto Anderson Bridge into the hairpin. Deceptively tricky, a curved braking zone making the approach very hard, and making the exit even trickier. Also the scene of that famous Massa overtake. Down the 2nd longest straight into another 90 but again super deceptive, as its not really 90 degrees anymore. Not sure when it was changed but removing the exit kerb made the wall the track limit massively opening the exit of corner. Send the car ink pick the throttle early into the final sector. Another curved braking zone into personally the worst part of the circuit tho still challenging. A 90 right into a 90 left, beware the wall as you immediately go 90 left again under the grandstand. Many drivers have fallen foul of the wall here. No room for error. 90 right immediately again, Vettel famously kissing the wall in his stunning 2017 pole lap. Into another 90 right and 90 left approaching the final corner. A high speed double left. Too fast and you off track lap deleted at the very end, too slow and lots of lap time loss.  All this, and thats not mentioning the bumps which are brutal for reliability and the driver, the humidity and heat which again pushes the cars and drivers to the limit and of course the little street track quirks, such as an underground train that passes under the track that caused a gearbox issue for someone on one of the early visits to Singapore. Then ofc the setting. Middle of a bustling city, the camera shots from the top of the infinity pool, the ferris wheel, the harbour. That helicopter shot over the long straight in Sector 1, with the Motorway passing over the track, showing racecars underneath and normal people doing their own thing above them, oblivious to the drama. Add its many iconic moments such as the Crashgate drama, the 2010 battle between Vettel and Alonso, the 2017 drama and the many, many spectacular pole laps makes it very much like Monaco. No overtakes, yet always dramatic. An opportunity for the best drivers to show why they are the best drivers on the grid. And the glamorous location.  Something the 80s USA tracks always failed to capture.


And I'm going to disagree and agree with you on China. Yes, no one particularly cares for it but its because it's a nothing track. It's not hideously awful. But not special. Yh T1 is unique, but its also kinda awkwardly long. Like it just never ends. Turn 2 is a rather forgettable hairpin, tho I'll  give it a tricky exit. Turn 3 is a kink in a straight, followed by 4 which is just a hairpin with nothing to it. The esses (which is really just an S. Its one left and one right) is a straight rip off Malaysia, but with no elevation. Just flat. Its then immediately followed by 2 awkward left handers, which never decided if they wanted to be 2 quick kinks or 2 90 degree corners and instead are just neither. These corners honestly are even worse because they influence the exit of the S, so you can't even really enjoy the S because you finish the high speed corner by slowing down, rendering the high speed corner rather unimportant for lap time (130r at Suzuka suffered a similar fate. A spectacular corner, but being flat through it was not a big advantage since it was followed by the chicane almost immediately after, making yhe chicane more important in terms of lap time as it preceded the long straight). The rest of Shanghai is actually fine imo, but it was clearly designed for a pre-DRS F1. Since DRS its suffered a similar fate to Spa, where every overtake is the same ""push button to claim a place"". Before that most of its exciting Grand Prixs came from rain from its late in the Calendar date. Since moving to an earlier April date, it's not really had the rain to spice up races. So honestly its just okay. Perfectly forgettable and I don't think many would lament its removal from the calendar if that were to one day occur",:we-say-no-to-mazepin: #WeSayNoToMazepin

In that case you would develop a more balanced car for both your driver's to win the constructor championship.

formula1,"You don't need to pick one immediately especially since teams can and will changing over time except few. Here are some ""artistic impressions"" of current teams:

* Mercedes: The well-oiled engine team. The typical german: everything is so perfect and best but when it failed, it failed catastrophically.

* Red Bull: The hip ""young"" team. But behind the parties and fun they still fast and hungry to win. Known to have innovative tricks that might not be exactly legal.

* Ferrari: The oldest team around, it's the only team that survived since the beginning of F1 in 1950. Everyone know Ferrari, everyone at some point want to have a Ferrari car in their garage. However like old men, they also love to play politics and famous to get more benefit from FIA.

* McLaren: The eternal rival of Ferrari. Forget Mercedes vs Red Bull, or Lewis vs Max, F1 is defined by McLaren vs Ferrari. The rivalry that surely will become the headline of F1 again in the future. If Ferrari is passionate Italian team, McLaren is the professionally perfect British team defined by Ron Dennis, although it's transforming into the fun team under new management.

* Alpha Tauri: The darling underdog team since it's first inception as Minardi. They always have low budget and often slow, but what they have is the heart. They have it better since bought by Red Bull to be the B team, but the old Minardi soul is still there. If Red Bull feels like a child who throwing away drivers they don't like, Alpha Tauri is the child that will polish imperfect driver to next level.

* Alfa Romeo: Previosuly Sauber, one of the oldest surviving team. Just like Alpha Tauri, they often has low budget but famous as the team who polishing young talent to their potential. Peter Sauber build his team reputation as he has good eye for spotting talent, gaining love from the fans even though he's not involved in F1 for very long time now.

* Alpine: Has gone through many names but the heart of the team is still the same: the team from Enstone. They always considered as the dark horse of F1, especially when being operating as Renault factory team.

* Aston Martin: Formerly Force India and something else that people still called Force India. Don't let the specific country name fool you though, they are the team that famous for punching above their weight. They might be a typical midfield team, but when opportunity present itself, they often grabbed a podium.

* Williams: After Ferrari and McLaren, there's Williams as the third oldest team in F1 and also one of the most successful, despite their position right now. Williams is famous for the only family ran team which last until last year. They're the most traditional team, as traditional as you can be, in F1.

* Haas: The youngest team in F1. Despite their position right now, they are pretty successful on their early years, certainly much better that many new teams that comes and go in F1 history. Their problem is exacerbated by development freeze in 2020-2021 season when their 2020 car has major fundamental problem, but with new enforced technical team from their tight partnership with Ferrari and focus on 2022 regulation, they could be a big surprise next season.",:mclaren: McLaren

If it's a slight misstep to go outside the kerb which is 3ft outside the tarmac, where do we stop? If they can't stay inside the bounds of the kerb which is an extension of the track, time to reign it in.

No one tries to damage the car on purpose but these are the best of the best, I expect them to be able to keep it within the limits of the track.

The fact were back here having the very same arguments about track limits continues to prove how horrible these designs are because without something that causes damage, there is little fear to go over the limit.

formula1,"&gt;Because releasing a car with loose tires is a way bigger danger than the thin allegations about a team who's simply quicker than others and never had a single problem in like a decade. You're acting like you're the voice of reason but your reasoning 


Like everyone is suggesting, teams often make these sort of complaints for selfish reasons under the guise of 'safety'. Like you said, this complaint is probably Merc simply trying to gain an upper hand. I have never said this wasn't the case. The allegations may or may not be bullshit, but once they get to the FIA, if there ends up being a genuine problem then it's still an issue.

&gt;Again, this is pure and simple speculation and no reason to suspect this has been given aside from ""they're just so good"", hence why your whole premise is flawed in my opinion.

I said multiple times in the main post that this is a **potential** issue. I specifically said, many times, that RB could well just be acing their stops and they're not doing anything wrong. We just don't know, and nobody here can clarify whether this is actually an issue. My entire point is that although we simply don't know, if there is still the **potential** for problems (which the FIA seem to think is the case), then it is their duty of care to try and mitigate them.",
formula1,"Flame aside. Is there any sort of pressure sensor that could be applied to the wheel nuts that could be use to prevent the car to accelarate too much with a loose wheel??

My Megane has some sort of pressure sensors to check for deflated tyres. I think the FIA could have pute some engineers to good use and research something to really solve the issue. Or at least they could bank some PhD student to do that for them.",
formula1,"tldr:

&gt;This is good and right because it's proactive. Being proactive means taking an action based on no data. To prove this, here's a few examples of actions being taken based on data. Trust me, it makes sense. Also any benefits to Merc are entirely coincidental

Yes there was the engines of course and maybe Red Bull and Renault knew 2014 might not be as strong.

Red Bull had the clear advantage so it made sense to chuck that but extra into the 2013 car so secure the title and dominate since 2014 was a wild guess (like this year). I don‚Äôt think Red Bull expected though just how far ahead Mercedes would be and for how long",

1. His longest serving teammate has been Ricciardo. Although his reputation is down right now because of his struggles at McLaren, back in 2016 Ricciardo was universally considered one of the very best drivers on the grid.

2. The gap between Mercedes and Red Bull was always substantial from 2016 to 2020. Mercedes was faster everywhere but a few races each season.

3. Apart from the early parts of 2019 and 2020, Red Bull has generally been clear of the midfield.

4. Max has competed in 128 races I believe

5. Verstappen has suffered horrible reliability from both Renault and Honda until this season, much worse than Mercedes.",
formula1,"With how close the midfield can be, to make it into Q3 you need to use the softs, and then starting P11 just gives you the advantage.. and for the top teams they are far enough ahead to qualify on whatever they want.

formula1,"&gt;  Lucky red flags, safety cars, 0 DNF's or mechanical issues, multiple big pieces of contact with no consequences, puncturing but still winning, gaining positions on penalties, not facing any real consequences for causing incidents etc.

&gt; Nobody got this lucky in the entire history of the sport it's genuinely obscene.

I will admit that it's probably a bit selective since he has also had bad luck a few times and did lose some podiums due to penalties, but yeah sometimes his luck feels ridiculous. But you can't really blame *him* for that. 

The absolute peak was the VSC last year in Imola. Starts just before he can enter the pit lane and ends literally just as he drives away from the pits. I 100% believe that it was just insane luck/awkard timing from whoever's responsible for VSC, but I think everyone's inner tinfoil hat exploded at that moment.",:marussia: Marussia

formula1,"No, he did not escape from the side of the halo. The side areas of the halo are too small for the helmet to go through.

Grosjean escaped from the top, however part of it was blocked by the guard rail and the cockpit was on its side, hence why it looked narrower than usual.

I don't know how much the windscreen can take, but I'd assume it wouldn't be able to protect him from the guard rail as the halo did.",:pastor-maldonado: Pastor Maldonado
