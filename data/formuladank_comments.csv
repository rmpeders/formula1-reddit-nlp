He is also unquestionably likeable and charming so there is basically no room for any disagreements about him lol. It's just ""Carlos is great"" ""Yep, moving on"".

While with Leclerc, Max, Lewis, Russel and the likes there can be endless discussions between different takes on weather they are actually good or if they are just lucky / it's just the car / they are inconsistent / crash too much / good but have bad attitude and so on. They have fans hyping them for their talent, and others arguing that they are over hyped.

But Carlos just put in hella effort and effort is boring to hype and therefor there is no need for the argument that he's over hyped either. Everybody is just going ""well he said after quali that he would go home to do homework on starting p2 in sochi so it makes sense he would have a good start, not that noteworthy""

Don't get me wrong, I think his efforts deserves to be so much more noticed. Working hard is much more impressive than talent in my book. I love Carlos, he is my favourite driver. But effort and hard work is not glamourous :| so it will not get the attention it deserves in a sport like this.

formuladank,"To add to that she was a mediocre driver at best, never won anything significantly and somehow she go a test driver seat at IIRC Williams (but could have been another team). While there were far more competent women in the feeder series at the time. Then after basically being out paced by just about every testing driver at that team by a significant margin she gets a spot on some ""women on motorsport"" commission all while publicly stating that women can't compete against men in things like F1 instead of trying to promote motorsports to potential female drivers.

For that shit she got into a very public row with Mich√®le Mouton (the female rally driver who almost won the rally championship in 82) someone who has been not only groundbreaking as a female driver but also always supported more inclusion of women on an equal level with men in motorsports.

Jorda can probably drive a car way better than I can but she just got lucky/had the right connections to make her way to the top. She has no real racing record to speak off while there were way better female drivers around the same time and I cannot shake the feeling that the reason she got that spot on that commission is because Bernie liked looking at her ass",Proxy Paige

formuladank,"&gt;How are they incentivized to only have one competitive driver? 

Think about it this way: 

Remember how Rosberg and Hamilton fought like crazy when they were teammates from 14-16? 

Imagine if they were teammates still in 2017, when the ferraris were matching the mercs. Seb was clear #1 and kimi was #2. If a win was attainable for the Ferrari, it was seb who would get it. 

But if a win was attainable for the Merc, then you'd have both lewis and nico fighting for it and splitting wins. 

So let's say in a given season, Mercs win 10 races and Ferraris wins 10.

As a clear #1, seb wins all 10 of those races.

But as equals and intense rivals, maybe nico gets 4 wins and lewis gets 6.

So when you tally it all up, seb wins that title because Lewis and nico were fighting each other.

From the team's perspective it's much better to have a defined #1 and a guy who always comes in 2nd behind him. 

As a fan it sucks, because it removes an element of competition... But that's why the teams want it that way.


&gt;Does that apply to all teams?

Kinda but it mainly applies to teams in title contention. That's when it really starts to count.

You mentioned on another comment how ""you've been in Russell's position"". I have to assume then that you have never been in Bottas's. What driver stays left when preparing to take a left? Much less while defending?

I know you have heard Brundle say all the time ""you have to leave a car's width"". He did. But it is some how Valtteri's fault for doing that?

Yes TCS, or TCR, or Traction Control, prevents wheel spin or lost of traction, very useful in the rain or in circuits with slow corners

And LCS, or Launch Control system, controls wheelspeed, gearshifts, clutch and other to allow for the perfect launch

That why Schumacher's launchers are suspicious, the system in the Benetton's ECU was LAUNCH CONTROL

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Do you know that the sound is easily recognizable? 

Why do you think Senna stood on the first corner in Aida, he was listening to the blown diffuser, thought was TCR, launched an inquery, it was LCS

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;is Monaco the only GP?? I'm asking why his starts mostly sucked entire year.

Of course they wouldn't be dumb enough to use it everytime, it would make that painfully obvious, also remember, the FIA was investigating them, using it every race was asking for a disqualifying

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The rule changes that came mid94 after Senna's death that costed Benetton a lot, because their budget was much lower than Williams'.  
&gt;  
&gt;But you don't even know the difference between LCS and TCS, of course you wouldn't know this, too.

I was talking about Schumacher launches and you insist I'm talking about TCR, for some fucking reason, the idiot here is clearly you

 If you look at how they defend at the end of straights before a hard braking zone, they either hold their position or make a move to block. I consider following the racing line as holding position. Say these guys are on a track with a cement runoff instead of a gravel trap.

formuladank,"I'll admit that I shouldn't have said that, I was out of line and I'm sorry.

The main thing that I think is that most means does not mean something like slightly over 50%. I believe that it is much higher than that. Somewhere like 70-90%. However, they have never been ""quite quicker"" at any tracks. In Monaco Lewis probably would have been able to challenge Max if he didn't mess up his quali, in Austria Max is an expert at that track and Checo clearly showed that the Red Bull's only had a slight pace advantage at best, since he did pretty average there and didn't beat the Mercs once, and they definitely had a pace advantage in Baku. Merc has only had a Baku like pace advantage at Portugal and Spain. I would say Red Bull has on more occasions had a slight pace advantage, while Merc has had more races where they had a large pace advantage.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to agree with you on the bias. There is clearly a lot of bias against Lewis. He was clearly the better driver in 17/18. In 17 he kept up with Seb in the first half of the season where the majority of tracks were low downforce and when the tracks started to suit him he blew Seb away. In 18 he kept up with Seb and then Seb collapsed under pressure and by the time the Ferrari was quite a bit worse in the USA Lewis had already won the title because of Seb's repeated mistakes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now though, Max is better. Max has been consistent and Lewis has been making multiple mistakes like in Imola, where he would have been out of the points if not for luck, in Monaco where he qualified P7, and then in Baku where he locked up and ran wide. Max has made errors in Bahrain, where he ran wide and lost the lead and then in Imola where he messed up his quali lap and qualified p3. Due to Lewis's mistakes I would have to put Max ahead of Lewis in terms of quality right now. You could also count Lewis's mistake in Austria where he damaged his car, but I don't know enough about how he got that damage.

formuladank,"I actually slightly disagree with you regarding Senna‚Äôs death.

Yes, Senna‚Äôs death had a huge impact on the team, and I‚Äôm sure the legacy of it haunted them for quite a while.  That said, their performances in 1994, 1996, and 1997 to me suggest that they at least managed to wrestle a degree of control over those demons.

In my opinion, in the long run, Senna‚Äôs SIGNING to Williams has had a longer lasting negative impact on the team‚Äôs attitude.

If I can pinpoint one period in time that started the consistent downward spiral Williams fell into, it was the drama at the end of the 1992 season involving the bickering between Prost and Senna over the Williams seat.  Think about it, by the time 1993 rolled around, Williams had the two greatest drivers in the history of the sport (at the time) basically throwing themselves at Williams, Senna going as far as willing to accept a $1 contract.

That‚Äôs has to get to a person‚Äôs head (Frank, Patrick, etc).  To me, it seems like from then on, it was one drama episode after another regarding Williams drivers.  From their, the trend of Williams hiring rookie drives (Villeneuve, Frentzen, Button, Montoya) really takes off.  Obviously those drivers were not nobodies, but Williams, as ‚Äúthe best team on the grid‚Äù could get away with paying those guys smaller salaries, and constantly threaten them with replacement by the next hot name.  To them, it didn‚Äôt matter who was in the car, because they were Williams and they built the best cars.

By the time Montoya left Williams, he had earned himself a reputation as a diva.  Fair enough, he was a bit of a diva.  But part of what earned him that reputation was hat was perceived in the press as Juan ‚Äúthrowing Williams under the bus‚Äù when he was publicly critical of the team.  Now, I can understand an argument stating that Juan should have done his complaining behind closed doors, but that didn‚Äôt happen.  Or maybe it did, and it fell on def ears, which is why he went public.  Montoya‚Äôs ‚Äúattitude‚Äù wasn‚Äôt embraced by the media and the fans, because after all, this was WILLIAMS he was being critical of.  Who the hell was this upstart Colombian to publicly criticize the mighty Williams???  Turns out, 10, 15, 20 years after the fact when stories start coming out, Juan was actually correct about a lot of his criticism.  Maybe his methods could have been better, but the core of what he was getting at was true - that despite appearances on the outside, the team was not functioning like a World Championship calibre team.

And for the record, I am a bit of a Montoya fan so there‚Äôs maybe some bias in my thinking, but when I go back and watch old races and old interviews, yes, there are some times where Juan publicly blasted the team, but there was also times where he fully accepted responsibility for his own mistakes, which didn‚Äôt seem to get the same response from the media as his criticism.  Perhaps British media being protective of their darling British team? 

It would be like if George Russell joined Mercedes, and publicly criticized mistakes or misdirection being made by the team, and people responded with, ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs just George throwing the team under the bus.  This is Mercedes we‚Äôre talking about here, they don‚Äôt make mistakes like that.‚Äù  Then 20 years later insiders come out and say, ‚Äúwell, actually George may have had a point.‚Äù

It‚Äôs like, the whole thing has gone full circle.  In the 90s, it seemed like Williams didn‚Äôt care who drove the car, because the driver was just another component.  Now, it sort of seems like they don‚Äôt care who drives the car, because the driver is just a source of cash to keep the team going.",BWOAHHHHHHH

They can't eve see most of what's in front of them, sitting so low in the car, maybe they should be lifted if visibility is such an issue.

I remember last week people sucking Kimi's balls over him not even lifting when he gets through eau Rouge only to see the straight full of smoke, now the opinion is poor driver can't deal with low visibility despite being trained to use their peripheral vision, having the most training ever, the most safety equipment ever, and the easiest cars to drive ever. 

Drivers having to deal with difficult conditions is part of racing. If they feel like it's too much, be slower and lose time/points, simple.

No one decided to stop the race cause Lauda retired out of a championship. What the drivers do on track is always their choice.

Ocon is an average driver to be honest, he's good that's it. 

But Piastri is excellent at the moment.

And we all know Alpine won't be fighting for title by any means, their PU is literally the most weak on the entire grid.

Your last question is exactly my point. Not giving Piastri a seat just for a couple of years of Alonso is mighty stupid. As harsh as it may sound Alonso is not the future anymore, he's 40, age will catch up with him in the next 2 years. If he were 37 like Lewis or 34 like Vettel it would have been different but he's not.

And as I said losing Piastri to another team in favour of a couple of years is Alonso if very stupid.",BWOAHHHHHHH

I would reduce the number of superlicense points currently given to almost all but the top few positions in F2 and F3, and increase the number of points given to IndyCar so it matches F2. This doesn't change Piastri's situation, but with the new F1 financial rules pay drivers should be less needed in future. 

One cool thing though would be to give any F2 rookie champion a scholarship of say $1-5 million, paid for by F1, to only be usable to pay for an F1 seat. This gives great talents a better chance of getting an F1 seat. It's not $30 million, but it's something.",Trust the El üÖ±Ô∏èlan

Im not saying its not a racing incident. I just get really mad when people say its Russells fault when it clearly isnt.

Or Perez in sakhir last year. The list of great drivers is long and noone questions his place among them. But hes he only one I know that seems to always get away when he does make a mistake. And that just feel wrong. It seems he gets more opportunities to shine than anyone else. While thats surely exxegerated and he is excellent at using them, it makes it kinda boring because he likely wont make a mistake and even if he does, it doesnt have consequences.

And mistakes without consequences kill excitement and so kill the sport. And thats whats happening to a degree. This has nothing to do with lewis individually or his one in a billion driving capabilities. Just a fool would disagree that he is one of the GOATs. But killing excitement is no good.  
Also the fact that he is so insanely lucky when he needs it (which he does rarely) looks phishy, which results in all these conspiracy theories about bottas crashing on purpose and alike.",BWOAHHHHHHH

I think that says a lot about his sheer raw talent and state of mind as an athlete.  

As much as it feels like my fingers are being drawn through cactus needles every time the grid lines up the same way as it has for the past three years or so, I still have to admit, yes, Hamilton‚Äôs a good driver.  He‚Äôs probably our generation‚Äôs living legend.

As an Alonso fanboy, I can see why even more extreme fanboys think so. A lot of the Alonso worship revolves around the notion (for you and fact for me lol) that Alonso is at least almost a GOAT-level driver who has to haul shitboxes around way faster than they should be going, and there have been plenty of performances almost every year that make some (even in my biased opinion) insane people think he deserves a title. I mean hey, you gotta say dragging a car around a track on 2 tires for a whole lap and then finishing P7 is impressive, even if it required a safety car.

I also agree that Senna should NOT have won the 1990 title, although the '89 was definetly his, that was some high degree of BS that they did DSQed him for ""cutting the chicane"", the guy was stopped for 15 seconds, with a nacked wing and with the car engine dead, cutting there brought no advantage, also in 1990 the FIA in the drivers meeting said that cutting the chicane would not result in disqualifying

And yes, every winners car pushed the regulations right to edge of acceptability, but there is a clear difference in edge of acceptability and cross over it like it didn't exist, blow and double diffuser, split turbo, exploitation of power to weight ratios, DAS, even the Pink Mercedes, fuel freezing, flex wings, they were all innovations putting the rules to the limit. Option 13, Crashgate, Ferrari engines in 2018 and 2019, Spygate, Suzuka '90, those were all clear examples of cheating going directly to what the rules estipulated. 

My problem with Schumacher is that the arguments that people use against Hamilton or Senna apparently aren't valid against Schumacher, Senna cheated in 1990, and Hamilton have the best car since 2014, although Ferrari in 2017 and 2018 would contest that statement, but Schumacher cheating in '94 and '97, thankfully he lost this title, and bankrolling his '95 on the cash the team got from winning while cheating and not having their main rival, is ok? Why 2000 to 2004 Schumacher gets a pass with having the best car on the grid but Hamilton doesn't? Also '03 he had competition to the title, until Ferrari decided that the competition shouldn't have tyres anymore and Ferrari International Assistance agreed, and suddenly McLaren and Williams didn't had tyres anymore, with 3 races left on the calendar, they already started focusing in 2004, BTW, 2004 can be lumped in as well, since McLaren and Williams didn't developed their cars correctly due to needing to rebuild the 2003 suspension because Michelan needed to modify the tyres entirely, also did I mentioned that those tyres were in use since 2001 Monza?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There are only 2 reasons why Benetton and Schumacher had the '94 title, 1- Senna died, after Spain Williams was the car to be driving again and if Hill pushed Schumacher to Adelaide, Senna would have wrapped in Suzuka, if he was alive there would be no way in hell those fuckers would got away with it and 

Had Senna lived, the rule changes that hurt Benetton wouldn't come and Schumacher would win easily. But those penalties could've helped Senna of course.

Yes, it was clear as day that it was possible, and easy, to activate the system on the car, that's a driver aid, without an ounce of doubt

There are only 2 reasons why Benetton and Schumacher had the '94 title, 1- Senna died, after Spain Williams was the car to be driving again and if Hill pushed Schumacher to Adelaide, Senna would have wrapped in Suzuka, if he was alive there would be no way in hell those fuckers would got away with it and 2- Breatore is magical aparently",Fuck Liberty Media

So to explain it again. If in the last 10 years you can find some evidence of at the very least gray areas in 8 of the 10 teams. You can extrapolate it to any other time frame and have similar results.

So if every team or close to is trying their utmost to cheat every year without being caught. Complaining about them trying to cheat more performance out of the car is pointless.

Every teams wdc car will have dubious rules and straight outside of the rules aspect. You insulting fans for their opinion over who they PREFER on the GOAT race is mindblowing.

Senna isn't the goat. Nor Prost. Nor Schumacher, Hamilton, Vettel, Fangio or even Hill or Moss. They all can make a case for great drivers. 

People can have a goat case for a lot of things in a complex sport. That's why you will never be able to have a factual opinion over it or be able to judge people over what they think. Get off your high horse trying to make yourself believe senna was the true goat indubitably. Spoiler alert he wasn't. He was great. So were many other drivers. The fact that stirling moss has a shot at it in many people's eyes should be more than enough to make you realize IT IS DEBATABLE.

Should I repeat the question? If it were used, why were his starts horrible???

And FIA punished Benetton for everything that year, why didn't they because of that oPtiOn 13??

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;It was, the fueling system had the anti fire filter removed, that was illegal

They got the permission together with Ligier.

&amp;#x200B;

LMAO, I don't remember Senna getting nonsense penalties in 1990.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; that's not how F1 works, you can't punt people off the road because they are faster than you

Is this after you praising Senna? It was an all or nothing moment. most drivers would do the same.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Suzuka '97, Villeneuve was disqualified for not slowing to waved yellows, while in the year prior Schumacher got away with a deleted time

In 1996??

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;He kept racing like nothing never happened, he passed Hill on the formation lap, that against the rules, and he just ignored the stop-and-go, got justifiably desqualified

OK, you don't know and you don't even bother researching even after I told you.

He didn't ignore, incompetent and dumb FIA people didn't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;They were using the same tyres since Monza 2001, why now? Because Ferrari wasn't going to be able to walk at the title, so lets fuck the tyres

Monza2001? It was Imola2001.

 If you get confused too much, it means you don't know anything about the subject and just repeat something you've heard from somewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Mercedes is team that never got complacent, no matter how many doubles they get, the FIA made 2 rule changes and they kept delivering and I highly doubt that this years and next year will make any difference, but it's Hamilton's fault that the team actually work for the titles and don't expect those to fell into their lap like RBR did for a couple years after the V6THs and Ferrari did in 2017 and 2018, they deserve a title, who cares if they have illegal engines, double batteries and extra fuel, the tifosi deserve a title, like McLaren did from 2013 to 2017, Ferrari, Williams, and Force India got shaken by those changes, Mercedes and Red Bull kept their foot down and never let down, now that is Hamilton's fault?

Oh yeah, let's forget the other dominant eras being unterrupted by rule changes and Merc having a headstart for the hybrid era.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But yeah Merc bad cuz car good, HAM bad cuz Merc good team. Ferrari said fuck all in 2005 and cocked it up, but it's everyone else fault that they didnt got that title

formuladank,"Re pasted because Reddit deleted comments that tags other subreddits apparently

My first response would be it's formula dank not 1, no need for serious responses, but if your question is in good faith, I'll try my best to give you my personal opinion in good faith.

When it's the rear wing or tires or whatever on the car that is engineered, my personal opinion is it is irritating but I don't really care because where there's smoke there's fire. I believe every team cheats to an extent in F1, it's just a race to see who gets found out. That is why when Ferrari's engine got protested I didn't care; when Mercedes' DAS got protested I didn't care; when Red Bull's rear wing got protested I didn't care.

However, when you consider that this is the pit stop mechanic's reaction time that is being banned, it irks me. I'm sure we've all played the ""fit the circle in the hole"" game before. If you were to press the button only when you finally saw the circle fit, you'd fail every time, because the circle had moved on. After a while of practice, you learnt to anticipate it coming and press when it was milliseconds before the circle went in.

I don't know how red bull reacts so fast. Perhaps they anticipate it. Perhaps like choreography they do it through practice and achieve the highest possible level of anticipation. But when it is a human thing, anyone can achieve it through practice. To forcibly limit a human's reaction where there is no cheating possible, only practice, just because other teams' mechanics are too slow or didn't practice enough is just loathsome to me.

To be clear, I don't mind the part of the TD about automated systems. If red bull's pit stops are fast because their __equipment__ is illegal, by all means ban the equipment.

This is made worse by Mercedes always loving to take the high road. Compared to all dominant teams of the past, they are the only ones who pretend they wouldn't do absolutely anything to others to get ahead. I don't pretend Red Bull don't complain. Like Ferrari, Lotus, Williams etc of the past, they're mud slinging pigs too. Mercedes' complaints irritate me that bit extra becaude they preach pushing themselves to the max rather than dragging others down and say they love competition, only to pull 2 TDs in 2 races. 

This is my genuine opinion and if your comment was in good faith, so is mine. Hope to hear your response.",Vettel Cult

As a famous spanish driver once said: All the time, you have to leave da space.

That's how racing works. Of course you can't divebomb someone from a mile away and then ask them to accomodate some space for you, but especially if it's someone on the outside, you should be able to beat him fair and square without pushing him off track. You've got less distance to cover and especially in turn 6 there is not even a significant speed loss when taking a tighter line, so if the driver trying to overtake is still next to you at the exit of the corner it might just be because he has more pace at hand. Then, IMO, he is more than entitled to win the position. If we don't allow for that, say hello to even more DRS overtakes.

When someone insults you I doubt you are going to act all friendly. My point is that Red Bull is a slightly better car and that is it. When you say most, many people will think it is much higher than a small majority. You said in your original comment that the RB is much quicker, which it is not. It is only slightly quicker. You insulting me and then pretending that you are not is pure cowardice. Don't go back on your words. You either Apologize or you mean what you said, those are the two choices and what you are doing just makes it seem like you are too afraid to actually stand by your words.


Max is right now better and that is the reason they are ahead so much. If the RB was only better at 1 track then they would be only around 7 points behind, not 32. That is the mark of a better driver. He's limited the damage at tracks where Mercedes were better, won the tracks where they were even, and capitalized at the tracks where they were better.",BWOAHHHHHHH

I've lived my life in Canada, and I don't think I've ever had anyone pronounce my Hungarian surname correctly. Part of that is because of the letter combinations used, and the syllables it has, are never used in English. But does that mean that French speakers here are any better? Nope! I can assure you that it'll be butchered just as badly!

Pronouncing a name properly, especially if it's not one you're familiar with and using a spelling that isn't obvious, can be extremely difficult without context. Even when it's repeated. Syllables that aren't used in a language can be extremely difficult for a non-native speaker to even be able to properly pronounce. This applies to all languages (Example: Japanese speakers having difficulty with 'l'). So, while I'll happily help someone if they ask for the pronunciation, I'll also tell them the somewhat Anglicized version that's also considerably easier for them to say, repeat, &amp; remember.",BWOAHHHHHHH

formuladank,"Lewis left McLaren because he was in contention for the 2012 title and they kept fucking him over in the pits. He had no idea that 2013 would bring them an uncompetitive car incapable of getting podiums, and he wanted to stay on Mercedes power, as he is a Mercedes driver and always has been. That left him one place to go, and it turned out to be perfect. It was his only option, and it was a big winner.

The real loser in that situation was Checo Perez, who would've been Alonso's rear gunner in a Ferrari drive in 2014 but he felt he had a chance to move to what was the strongest team with the strongest car at the time and didn't want to spend another year with a minnow after tasting champagne so many times. That was a bad career move, although, admittedly again, one that was only bad with hindsight. McLaren wanted him bad because he was running in the podium places in a Sauber that was way off the pace and beating Kobayashi, who was considered at the time to be a prodigy.  


F1 development is so unpredictable! Sure, Alonso had a chance to drive at Brawn, replacing Rubens, but the news was that they wouldn't make it to the grid the next year and Honda was ridiculously uncompetitive the year before that, so they got to keep their two drivers and that's why Jenson became world champion (because he didn't have the form any other year to be even close) and people were shitting on him at the time for remaining with a minnow like Honda/Brawn even after they'd lost the works engines.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, Vettel did not exactly win any world titles for Ferrari. I would argue he was less in contention for them than Alonso was, despite having superior machinery relative to his predecessor. It wasn't exactly a good move!  


I don't think it's fair to criticize drivers for not being psychic or lucky or #blessed or whatever and knowing what car will be the best the next year during the silly season of the previous year. Sometimes they get it right like Lewis did. Sometimes they get lucky like Jenson did. Sometimes they get it wrong like Alonso or Perez or Kobayashi did. All of these dudes could've been title contenders or champions if they just knew what would happen in the future. But for some people to get lucky, others have to get unlucky.

The tan interior is pretty ugly even though it's in good condition. Silver lining is the GF and I like the SF 49ers and the team colors match so it can be fun to go out on sundays, I took some friends out when they were in the superbowl.

But yeah you're right the car is ridiculous looking. I think I've just embraced the fun parts of it, put on some crazy outfit and go be a moron for a couple hours. The people that seem to be into the car are in their 40s-50s which fits the demographics. One guy wanted to buy it because his dad had one just like it when he was growing up. 

The funniest thing is that when I was a young kid my favorite movie was [RAD](https://youtu.be/7MCgFYzbom0) which is a ~~fantastic~~ terrible 80s movie about BMX biking. I remember the SUV from it really well and we saw it at a local car show recently. They re-released the movie on Amazon prime awhile ago and we watched it. The prizes for winning the race are $$$ and almost the same Corvette but in a T-top (@ 55 seconds in that link). It's the only thing I didn't remember from the movie because I was just into the biking and the SUV you could put bikes on LOL. 

A 73 TR6 looks like a blast to drive when it's working. My uncle has some old Triumph and BSA motorcycles which he's always fixing. The corvette isn't running right now since it started leaking some oil and the mechanic I know retired, haven't had time to find a new shop.",SIMPIN FOR RUSSELL

Them supplying Williams with engines shouldn‚Äôt really matter, the contract‚Äôs been signed back in 2019 and runs all the way to 2025.

Honestly it might seem very elitist or whatever but put in like this, I don‚Äôt care about someone‚Äôs opinion about a game on if its good or not if they haven‚Äôt played it themselves enough to at least be competent and understand its basic mechanics and story (if it has one), so why would I care about someone‚Äôs opinion on a sport when they‚Äôve only watched a series about it and all of they‚Äôre knowledge comes from it.

Meanwhile at AM things aren't really that promising in the short term, the low rake would help them in 2022 but it looks like the team has still focused more on 2021 in terms of development then Ferrari/Alpine/AlphaTauri/Alfa Romeo/Haas and I can remember some articles where the team wasn't hugely optimistic about 2022 and expected more at 2023 and beyond.

The other choice is what Masi did, and we all saw what kinda shitshow went on.

Also you can't say that Masi can't pull a red flag out of his ass, the rulebook has a clause giving Masi ultimate power, he can override and overrule against literally the entire rulebook.

That's just a given, but even then it will significantly limit the severity of symptoms. Number two, due to the obvious severity of the COVID pandemic the issue surrounding the long-term protection from the initial vaccines used to fight back against the pandemic wasn't a priority. It was essentially ""does it work? Yes? Okay do it"". Long term protection is something you can only develop with time, something we just did not have at the height of the pandemic. This will likely be resolved by a yearly vaccine (possibly), which is intended to give full protection for the year ala the flu shot.

Unfortunately it most likely is impossible that it will be eradicated. And while yes, it does constantly mutate, the issue for concern is less any mutation at all and more mutations that are vaccine-resistant. Because then, we're really shit out of luck. At that point, it's basically Pandemic 2.0. So at the absolute minimum, the significant limitation of that being possible is a pretty obvious priority.",FLAT ROUND HERE‚Ñ¢‚Ñ¢‚Ñ¢‚Ñ¢‚Ñ¢‚Ñ¢‚Ñ¢‚Ñ¢‚Ñ¢‚Ñ¢‚Ñ¢‚Ñ¢‚Ñ¢‚Ñ¢‚Ñ¢‚Ñ¢

There's still groups of people who don't get the same protection from vaccines as those in normal health.

That's literally how we eradicated smallpox. So while I get feeling it is pointless, even now that could not be further from the truth. To ensure that more strains of the disease that are vaccine-resistant don't crop up and to ensure these vulnerable groups are protected, the complete eradication of the disease is more or less required.

The reason behind the change was explained last year. The local government wants to promote their region (Emilia Romagna) instead of promoting another country that has nothing to do with the race.

You have to remember that San Marino is not in Italy, it's actually a small semi independent state and they had to borrow the Imola circuit because they didn't have one of their own. Now probably something has changed, the region of Emilia Romagna itself is trying to make the track relevant in a local context (it's not the Italian GP 2: Electric boogaloo after all, it's the Emilia Romagna GP) and could well have decided to give in and stop resorting to San Marino for the name/Money needed.",BWOAHHHHHHH

formuladank,"Well maybe I dont know much Chemistry since I am now a zoologist and an Anthropologist but as far as I remember Hydrogen is prepared industrially by Bosch process in which steam is blown over red hot coke. Water gas is produced in this but its not easy to separate hydrogen like that so it is again treated to steam in presence of Iron Chromate as catalyst which oxidizes the CO to CO2 and H2 is then collected by downward displacement of water.

Natural gas as you pointed out is not just saturated Methane( carbon surrounded by 4 hydrogen that you are talking about) . It would be rather strange if we could get isolated alkanes at such purity. What we get delivered at home is almost pure Methane(with added aromatic compounds so that you can detect leaks) but thats after refining. From this, we can make Syn Gas(syntheis gas which is used for making many compounds) from which Hydrogen can be formed.

It's not hard to miss, this bot and it's huge ass posts cluttering up literally every thread with a video, and you get fucking *DOZENS* of people requesting it and cluttering up every fucking thread so that 50% of the screen space is just this stupid ass bot because people are too stupid to *scroll down a page*. Fucking hell

And why on earth do this *LUDICROUSLY* cumbersome process of requesting a bot and waiting 10 minutes for it to reply and only then download the video

Do you know how I download videos? I press *THE DOWNLOAD BUTTON* and wait literally 2 seconds and it's downloaded to my phone or tablet. Imagine if to play a song on Spotify you clicked the song and then had to wait 10 minutes for a bot to respond and give you a separate link for the song you had to click and only *THEN* would the song play, when there's an option to just click the song and have it play immediately, but using this cumbersome bot method cluttered up the playlist of literally everyone else who uses Spotify, ruining the experience for them. That'd be really really stupid wouldn't it? Nobody would be dumb enough to do that, when there's also the option to just click the song snd have it immediately play. Who on earth would be so insane to use that method instead of using the immediate method that also doesn't clutter up everyone else's playlist. 

OK, so all you have to do is use *literally any other app* than the official Reddit one (the official Reddit app is by far the worst one) and they'll all have download buttons so you can just press a button and have it downloaded in seconds instead of doing this stupendously stupid slow cumbersome download process. And that way you won't be *ruining* reddit for every other user by continuing to clutter up every fucking thread. Jesus christ 

Android reddit apps that are much much better than the official Reddit app in no particular order:

1) Sync

2) Relay

3) Reddit Is Fun

4) Boost 

5) Infinity 

6) Now

7) Baconreader 
 
8) Joey
 
9) Slide 


iPhone reddit apps that are much much better than the official Reddit app in no particular order:

1) Apollo 

Please for the love of God just use one of them instead 


At the very least you could be considerate and just use the link of the first person who requested it instead of ruining threads with this clutter by requesting it again and again and again.

The first bot that did this, vredditdownloader, got banned by so many subs because people were too stupid to scroll down a page and so it cluttered up every thread, and so then it was just easier to ban it site-wide. And that will be the fate of this stupid ass bot too. Because people are still to stupid to know how to scroll down a page on a website or an app apparently.

Don't think this was a misunderstanding. The fight was pretty intense that year and their relationship took a hit after the Baku incident. During the drivers meeting at the Mexican GP, Lewis also claimed that Seb gained an advantage by running wide in the previous race (US GP) but it wasn't picked up by the stewards and was willing to share the GPS data with Charlie to back up him claim. My point is that the drivers try to play every mind game and gain every advantage over their rivals.

He dropped the ball in Italy where he should've easily won. Bad start and couldn't overtake a single car, yes he had some damage, but if he has an ok start he's at the front and doesn't take damage.

In Turkey, well... I mean he spinned more than Vettel in his whole career.

And he wasn't even able to win in Bahrain when Hamilton was absent. Yes he had bad luck with the pitstop. But if there wouldn't have been any pitstop drama, he'd still be behind Russell.

These are just 3 race on the top of my head in a seson with 17 races. I'm not saying he's a terrible driver, in F1 there are no terrible drivers.

He's awesome, to be a model at the same time f1 pilot (one of the greatest), but the way he advocates his political views is rather cringey and somewhat superficial. I mean rascism and climate change are completely complex matter and being preachy doesn't really do much on a juggernaut problem.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Clarke, 

Clark\*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Schumacher... Now listen here you little shit, '94, '97, '00, '03 were all bulshit, 

Wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;in '94 the car had Launch Control

Didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; and the fuelling system was rigged 

was not.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;and he crashed Damon Hill out of the finale,

Schumacher deserved it anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; also he got blackflagged in Silverstone, 

For a dumb reason

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;kept racing, 

Why do I get the feeling that you know nothing about F1??

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;and when he was justifibly desqualified 

Was not fair.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;he threw a tamtrum to get the win back, 

didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;that he wasn't even racing, he got blackflagged for passing Villeneuve on the formation on both starts,

Wait? Wasn't it Hill??

I think you don't even know which season, race or driver you're talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; the race got stopped on lap 1 and the rules said to a standing start again, 

What??

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;also Villeneuve got desqualified from Suzuka for not slowing down enough for a yellow flag, even though Schumacher on the same track, on the same corner, but one year early for the same infraction got his time in quali deleted,

What?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; but could keep racing. '00 He had Barrichelo hand him multiple wins 

Which races? and in 2000????

If it happened a lot, you should be able to name some.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;and '03 Ferrari made the tyre supplier for his title rivals change the tyres in a week, 

I won't even get into the details, because it's obvious you know nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;the behaviour was completely random as far as the teams understood, and he got crowned champion because McLaren and Williams suddenly did not understand how their tyres worked anymore.

Was it hard to make it all up?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; And in '02 and '04 his car was completely broken in relation to the field and people still insist that his car doesn't count but Hamilton's mercedes makes his titles void... FFS

Hamilton had dominant cars for a much longer time but of course you won't get it, too.",MISSION KIMOA

One thing you got to remember about Red Bull; everything they do outside their energy drinks, whether that's their commitment to F1, the football teams they own or heck, even their soapbox races they do to promote their brand.

And that's the part the FIA doesn't like about Red Bull; them being used as a marketing tool by Red Bull. Doesn't matter they have 4 WDC's, 4 WCC's, bring a lot of drama and 7 drivers on the grid that owe their F1 careers to Red Bull.

To them Red Bull has no business being in Formula 1, despite the name Red Bull being associated with F1 for 26 years. (Fun fact; that's just 2 years shorter then Marlboro who first appeared in F1 in ""72 and who's name got banished from F1 in 2000)

formuladank,"No absolutely I totally think the regulations need to slow cars down to stop everyone dying. I just wish they also made exciting cars. 

In fact I think the last aero changes to make the cars faster were stupid, because it hurt racing. As it made the cars faster on the straights, but made it impossible to follow through the corners. 

But for single seater cars, weight doesn't just affect lap time but also how agile they are, their breaking distances, and that kind of stuff. All of the current drivers want smaller lighter cars to allow them to race closer and for driving them to be more fun.

Also lighter cars are more efficient and better for the environment. Both on track and moving them around the world. 

When I first started watching they weighed 575 kg, next year they're going to weigh 790kg! You can see the difference, they look sluggish changing direction and moving from breaking to acceleration and vice versa. It stops really tight wheel to wheel racing because you can't flick the car around as easily. Remember Mansell and Senna wheel to wheel the entire way around Monaco? I doubt we'll ever see that again with these new oil tankers. 

It's also a run away feedback loop, heavier cars need more power and bigger breaks to get the same performance, which makes them heavier...",BWOAHHHHHHH

Any other team where someone didn't have a stake in the operation like at Williams they'd absolutely have been replaced. Aside from maybe Haas because they've never been good unlike Williams. 

Did Frank wield a lot more control over the company than I heard about which made it impossible for her to do what was needed? Micromanaging and undermining her?
